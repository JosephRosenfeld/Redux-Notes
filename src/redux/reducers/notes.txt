Each piece of state will only have one reducer so the naming convention for
files in the 'reducers' folder should be singular. {stateVar}Reducer.
Each file will export a reducer. within the reducers folder there will be an
index.js file which will combine all the reducers and also set the name of the state
variable.

Those combined reducers are then exported into the store.
