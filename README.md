# Redux-Notes
This is a project that utilizes React and Redux to build a very simple account balance app.

The point of this project is to showcase best practices with Redux specifically

This project was inspired from the youtube video linked below, however there is a large degree of seperation
from the youtube video as things listed there either weren't best practice or are now outdated methods
for building a react app that uses redux. 

Throughout the project there are well documented notes regarding this redux-react app's structure, functionality, best practices, and other miscellaneous details.
Please click into the files to see the notes (in the form of comments) or open any notes.txt files in order to read.
